Question:

1. Download a suitable dataset for classification from any Repository. List the attributes and its type in a word Doc. 

2. Import the dataset and divide the dataset in to Training and Testing dataset. Apply SVM classifier (use given kernel type) to build model using Training Dataset.
a. Kernel Type = Radial basis function (RBF), gamma=0.6
b. Kernel Type = Linear
Predict class label for data items in test Dataset. Print the Confusion Matrix and Calculate the accuracy of the predictions. Visualize the classifier results

3. Upload in your github account. Provide the link for access.
